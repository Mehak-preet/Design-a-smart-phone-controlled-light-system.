Aim:     Design a smart phone controlled light system.
Apparatus: Arduino Uno,bluetooth,breadboard,resistance,led.
Procedure:
step1:
take the Arduino UNO with the Breadboard .
Step2:
take 1 Bluetooth and led and join the vcc and ground of bluetooth with arduino.
step3:
then we connect bluetooth with phone .
step4:
give the response to circuit through your phone either ON or OFF.
step5:
if you press ON ,led will glow and vice versa.
